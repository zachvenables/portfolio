Lab 5

-This lab is a simple maze generator for a default 20x20 maze.
-The size can be edited by changing the public variable Size in the mazeGenerator script
-If you decide to make the maze larger, you can use the arrow keys to navigate the camera.

-The maze is generated by using Prim’s Algorithm.  The nodes are represented by a list of Node objects that are created in the script.  
The maze is represented by an arrayList of KeyValuePairs that represent the edges.  The maze is constructed and then the walls are carved 
out by checking the edges in the arrayList.
