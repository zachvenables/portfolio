### Static Web Design
* Static web page generator using MiddleMan.  

### Requirements

Must install bundler: https://bundler.io/

### How to Run
Clone the repo, then change directory into `FacultyRedesign`. Run `bundle install` to ensure all gems and dependencies are installed. Then run `bundle exec middleman server` to build the website and host it locally. You can then visit the site at the address specified in the command line output. Changes made to an ERB template should be reflected on page refresh, even while the server is running.
