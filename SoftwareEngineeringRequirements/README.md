#Software Engineering Product Development

This folder and the subsequent documentation lays out the necessary details regarding the team’s proposed software solution. 
Initially, there will be several documents detailing the various steps of the process, with a final document including all the documentation. 
Below, a quick summary of each of the documents is given, and any further information will be found within the documents themselves.

## Business and Enterprise Analysis

In this section, the team discusses the research of the chosen enterprise (Emxsys), the analysis of the team’s business, and the software 
portfolio of the team’s solution. In the research section of Emxsys, the topics of its industry segment, products and services, market, business and 
organizational structure, value chain, and stated areas of differentiation of other similar businesses are detailed. In the analysis section, a 5-Force Analysis 
is completed to show Emxsys’s place in the industry, and the team then uses scorecards to illustrate how its software will be able to out-perform Emxsys’s current system in 
order to be a leader in the industry. In the software portfolio section, the team will show several features it can implement to further separate itself from competitors and give a few further applications to be created.

## Intended Software Engineering Process

The team will begin to design the Software Document Lifecycle (SDLC) in this section. A spider-diagram will be created to show how the project will be shaped using various 
methods. In addition, software work-products will be shown in order for the team to illustrate each phase of the SDLC with necessary rationale for each. Also, the team will 
provide an evaluation of the chosen project shape and how it will work with the other sections of the project.

## Requirements Analysis

In this section, the team will lay out all the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the work-products detailed in Section 2 that are necessary for the software 
development. In addition, the team will provide evaluation of all the requirements given and the necessities of each chosen requirement.

## Artchitecture

The team will illustrate the technical architecture of the system in this section. By using the functional and nonfunctional requirements, the team will provide an 
encompassing document on how exactly the system will work and what it aims to achieve. In addition, the team will provide an evaluation for the architecture to determine 
the most necessary and immediate needs of the architecture to achieve a minimum viable product.

## Project Planning

Here, the team will provide a plan to implement the project that has been determined to be the initial solution. The team will develop a Project Schedule with the 
Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition stages with activities for each stage. Also, the team will incorporate a Risk Plan to identify potential risks and 
mitigation strategies. Finally, a Release Plan will be completed to illustrate the team’s goals to begin producing a usable product with various iterations.
